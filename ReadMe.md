Safety as a Service -

With the crime rates growing everyday in the US, there is a dire need for additional precautions to be taken by people when travelling outside, especially when alone.

The application aims at providing an additional level of security to the user. This will be achieved by utilizing crime data from the datasets provided by the government. This data will be used to segregate the regions of a city into color coded categories based on the density of crime in them. The user can choose to see this color coded map at any time using the app and decide their route based on that.

Further, using our application the user can opt to be tracked before starting their journey. When the user enters a relatively unsafe region, their live location is sent to 1 or more emergency contacts. If during their travel, the user feels unsafe or is in danger, user can press an SOS button (which is similar to the SOS feature of the mobile phone) which immediately notifies their emergency contacts and other users of the application who are in close proximity (who have turned on their location data) so that they can provide the requisite help. The user can opt out of this feature at any future time.

Even though there are applications both on web and mobile platforms which provide these features, there is no one application which combines both together. Combining these two parallel features helps the users immensely more than using the features independently. This is the main aim of the application.
